# HOTS_Random

## Description

HOTS_Random is a project dedicated to providing a random hero selection for the game Heroes of the Storm (HOTS). It aims to make the game more interesting and challenging by adding an element of unpredictability to the hero selection process.

## Why HOTS_Random?

HOTS_Random is a project that I started to learn Javascript and the dom. I have been playing HOTS for a while and I wanted to make a project that would be useful to me and my friends. I also wanted to make a project that would be useful to other people. I hope that this project will be useful to you.
